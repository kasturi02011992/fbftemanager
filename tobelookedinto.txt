=======
1) Code refactoring for services (mainly Autowiring the interfaces in controller)
2) Implement generics.
3) Use Abstract classes instead of interfaces for DAOs and implement CRUDRepo 
(keep abstract methods as it is, and write custom methods)
4) use wadltojava tool for stub/client model generation 
(See: http://cxf.547215.n5.nabble.com/How-to-generate-rest-client-with-wadl2java-td5738281.html)
